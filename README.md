      Went into Active Directory Administrative Center and enabled the Recycle Bin. This way if the wrong thing gets deleted, it can be retrieved.    
      To create a HelpDesk account with Admin privledges I copied the existing Administrator account, and called it HelpDesk    
      I created an Organizational Unit named "\_IT-Department" and moved the HelpDesk user account into it.    
      Using an underscore helps organize all of the Organizational Units at the top in one place.

### Other:
    I am absolutely blown away by Microsoft Viva, and the accessibility features that Microsoft has pu tin place. Viva is such an amazing tools for businesses. I highly value learning and intellectual progress at any cost. It has been something that drives my very being. For companies to use something like Viva in order to help progress the intellictual well being of thei employees is just beyond anything I would expect. It is something that I hope is successful and leads the way to other big tech companies trying to compete in that unreached niche of the market. Incredibly inspiring. I've set myself to, when I go to bed (wife is still stuck in Nevada so it's just me again) I want to watch some videos on YouTube on Viva. This motivates me greatly.
    Also, accessibility: In my opinion, accessibility has been something a lot of companies have done grudgingly. whether it is building a ramp to a door or adding properties to an image on HTML5 front ends. And frankly, not being directly effected by blindness or other things, I have given that little thought. But lateley, seein gmy oldest son having an extreme case of ADHD and even thinking he had terrets at one point, and how that affected his education, plus with myself being diagnosed with PTSD and seeing hows just a sound or a flash of light or anything can not only distract me, but send an adrenaline rush through me, to see that Microsoft has tackled even problems like these is incredibly noteworthy. Who would thi8nk that was a thing that a computer program could have a positive effect on?

### Other:
  The wife's new flight was cancelled, and getting my children back from Phoenix (where their mother lives; I have primary custody) was a nightmare. I was not able to start courses until about 1700. Missed a lot of daytime, so I am planning on a late night to catch up.
  In going through this course, I found that the default execution policy was set to unrestricted! I changed it to RemoteSigned. Glad that came up. I wonder if that is a Windows 11 default... For most of this hour long part, I have been experimenting with the commands before he even got to them. Fun stuff. It's nice to feel productive, learn so much, and learn it well.
  Worked until 0100 AM so I'm shutting down. Made some great progress and had fun doing it.

### Other Things
  Today was very busy. Trying to fix my wife's flight back home from Nevada, and then my only working vehicle died (battery crapped out due to its age and being in these incredible temperatures). So I spent a couple of hours trying to find somene available to hit me up with a ride to an autozone where I purchased a replacement. Due to the holidays (and it being a work day) most people were either busy at work or not in the state. My time spent on courses was unfortunately very short due to this.

  The initial setup took longer than it would have, as I installed a fresh Windows Server 2016 on Virtual Box. The server lab I created a few days ago had a static IP and had been toyed with enough that I figured I would start fresh. In addition, I wanted to update PowerShell and the ISE.
