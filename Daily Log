  I realized I needed to shift my focus back into IT. The stress that my ending in the Navy, after 14 years of honorable service, put on me and my family put me in a strange state of mind. After all the work I put into IT, and Computer Science, I decided to go get my CDL and drive a truck instead. It was a rash and insane period. Now I am back and I have little time to prepare for my next career.
  Today I went through many Indeed.com jobs offered in the local area in IT to see what was generally required. Without a certification or relevant degree (people still require Bachelors Degrees for this stuff!) I all but decided that some type of help desk support might be my first option. That being said, I have dived into the YouTube channel of "Kevtech IT Support" who has an incredible library of hands-on style videos.
  I have reinstalled VirtualBox, cleaned it up a bit, and then installed Windows Server 2016 on VB.
