Overview:

  - 

  Today I:
       Created a Windows 10 ISO for a virtual machine (offline, limited use kind of setup). On the Windows 10 machine, I enabled the Administrator account, logged in with that, then deleted the user account.  I then installed some RSAT Tools, including Active Directory, Remote Desktop, and a few others. The idea is to simulate a Help Desk role on a Windows 10 machine, similar to what I might be dealing with if I get a Level 1 Helpdesk job.
       In addition I created a user account and on my helpdesk account I added a group called HR. I placed the new user "Jane Doe" into the HR group.
       
    
  
  Closeout:
       I honestly should have focused more on training and labbing. I think I could be much further along. I had several things I had to do outside the house, but I let myself get too distracted today. Tomorrow will be better.
    
  
  Reviewed CMD commands today: 
     ipconfig - (of course)
     ping - (self-explanatory)
     net user [user] /domain - for all the user information (password expiration, account status, date and time of password set, last login, workstation permissions, etc...)
