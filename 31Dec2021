  Today I:
    While continuing the help desk lab setup, I realized a mistake I was making: I was forgetting that therte is a difference between a user and an asset. I was creating virtual desktops and naming them by the user instead of something like "Desktop-1" etc... This could be very confusing. If an asset must be moved, though the name of an asset can be changed, why would that be a limitation I would want to set up for myself. Instead users, assets, and groups should be separate entities.

  Alright I bit the bullet and purchased the Premium Membership for ITPro.TV.  Their courses are excellent, and professionally done. As good as free YouTube courses are, I need to get ready much faster than what I am getting.
  I've started the accelerated CompTIA A+ course. It is starting backwards a bit, but I need the review and I think I can get through this course pretty quickly.
  The courses that look interesting to me are:
